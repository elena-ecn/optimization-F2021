Introduction\n","Consider a simple formulation of rocket landing where the rocket state $x(t)$ is represented by its distance to the ground $d(t)$ and its velocity $v(t)$, i.e., $x(t) = [d(t), v(t)]^T$, where $t$ specifies time. The control input of the rocket is its acceleration $a(t)$. The discrete-time dynamics follows \n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","d(t+1) = d(t) + v(t) \\Delta t, \\\\\n","v(t+1) = v(t) + a(t) \\Delta t,\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","\n","where $\\Delta t$ is a time interval. Further, let the closed-loop controller be \n","\n","$$\n","a(t) = f_{\\theta}(x(t))\n","$$\n","\n","where $f_{\\theta}(\\cdot)$ is a neural network with parameters $\\theta$, which are to be determined through optimization.\n","\n","For each time step, we assign a loss as a function of the control input and the state: $l(x(t),a(t))$. In this example, we will simply set $l(x(t),a(t))=0$ for all $t=1,...,T-1$, where $T$ is the final time step, and $l(x(T),a(T)) = ||x(T)||^2 = d(T)^2 + v(T)^2$. This loss encourages the rocket to reach $d(T)=0$ and $v(T)=0$, which are proper landing conditions.\n","\n","The optimization problem is now formulated as\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","\\min_{\\theta} \\quad & ||x(T)||^2 \\\\\n","\\quad & d(t+1) = d(t) + v(t) \\Delta t, \\\\\n","\\quad & v(t+1) = v(t) + a(t) \\Delta t, \\\\\n","\\quad & a(t) = f_{\\theta}(x(t)), ~\\forall t=1,...,T-1\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","\n","While this problem is constrained, it is easy to see that the objective function can be expressed as a function of $x(T-1) and a(T-1)$, where $x(T-1)$ as a function of $x(T-2)$ and $a(T-2)$, and so on. Thus it is essentially an unconstrained problem with respect to $\\theta$. \n","\n","In the following, we code this problem up with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), which allows us to only build the forward pass of the loss (i.e., how we move from $x(1)$ to $x(2)$ and all the way to $x(T)$) and automatically get the gradient $\\nabla_{\\theta} l(x(T),a(T))$.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. A Better Problem Formulation\n","\n","Here is a list of things we discussed during the class that could help to make the problem more representative of the reality:\n","\n","1. More realistic definition of state and action spaces: Rocket orientation, angular velocity, etc. \n","2. Better dynamical model, e.g., drag\n","3. Constraints in state and action spaces\n","4. Controller design for a distribution of initial states rather than one\n","5. Randomness in dynamics, sensing, etc.\n","6. Discontinuity in modeling so that gradient cannot be computed, e.g., mechanical failures.\n","\n","In this project, please choose at least one aspect from 1 to 5 from the list to improve your problem formulation and solve the resultant problem. We will address 6 when we talk about reinforcement learning.\n","\n","Here is one example of problem formulation when we consider randomness in dynamics and initial states:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","\\min_{\\theta} \\quad & \\mathbb{E}_{\\{w(t), u(t), x(0)\\}}\\left[||x(T)||^2\\right] \\\\\n","\\quad & d(t+1) = d(t) + v(t) + w(t) \\Delta t, \\\\\n","\\quad & v(t+1) = v(t) + a(t) + u(t) \\Delta t, \\\\\n","\\quad & a(t) = f_{\\theta}(x(t)), ~\\forall t=1,...,T-1 \\\\\n","\\quad & x(1) \\sim \\Pr(x(1))\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","\n","Here $w(t) \\sim \\Pr(w(t))$ and $u(t) \\sim \\Pr(u(t))$ are modeled as i.i.d. noises added to the dynamics, and $\\Pr(x(1))$ is the distribution of initial states. We will approximate this problem using samples from $\\Pr(w(t))$, $\\Pr(u(t))$, and $\\Pr(x(1))$. To do so, we sample $\\{w(1)^{(i)},w(2)^{(i)},...,w(T)^{(i)}\\}_{i}^N$ from $\\Pr(w(t))$,  $\\{u(1)^{(i)},u(2)^{(i)},...,u(T)^{(i)}\\}_{i}^N$ from $\\Pr(u(t))$, and $\\{x(0)^{(i)}\\}_{i}^N$ from $\\Pr(x(1))$, where $N$ is the number of samples to be considered. Then we have the following problem instead:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","\\min_{\\theta} \\quad & \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N ||x^{(i)}(T)||^2 \\\\\n","\\quad & d(t+1)^{(i)} = d(t)^{(i)} + v(t)^{(i)} + w(t)^{(i)} \\Delta t, \\\\\n","\\quad & v(t+1)^{(i)} = v(t)^{(i)} + a(t)^{(i)} + u(t)^{(i)} \\Delta t, \\\\\n","\\quad & a(t)^{(i)} = f_{\\theta}(x(t)^{(i)}), ~\\forall t=1,...,T-1, ~i=1,...,N \\\\\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","\n","The code up this new problem, you will fully utilize the tensor operations in PyTorch. For example, the state tensor \"x\" will now become a N-by-2 matrix, where the first dimension represents the number of trajectories to be optimized. \n","\n","## 3.
